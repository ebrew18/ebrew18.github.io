    <h3>Who am I?</h3>
    <p>Hi, my name is Eric. At the time of writing this, I am 23 years old and live in Southern California, in the city of Riverside. I began learning to code in January of 2015, and it's become one of the best parts of my life. Seeing how websites and applications are designed and programmed is so interesting. When I first got interested in coding, it was the best decision of my life. I started learning from various websites, it made me incredibly happy to know that I didn't have to set foot in a classroom to pick up such a valuable skill. </p>
    <p>I don't really have a favorite language, but I do enjoy Javascript and Ruby in particular. If I had to list any shortcomings, it would have to be that I am still inexperienced. But I am looking to change that, and I eagerly await any projects coming my way.</p>
    <h2>Web Design</h2>
    <p>I am looking forward to getting into web design from a professional standpoint. I want to collaborate with others to make the most elegant, beautiful designs we can.</p>

  <div class="part2">
    <h2>Web Development</h2>
    <p>For a while now, I've been learning all the languages that I could get my hands on. I've become proficient in Ruby, Javascript, PHP, HTML (as you can see here), and a few others. I not only pick things up quickly, but I'm always eager to learn whatever is necessary to complete a project. I thoroughly enjoy learning and being able to use new code.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="part3">
    <h2>What can I do for you?</h2>
    <p>Anything you need. If I can't do it, I'll learn how or find someone who can. I love working in a group. It's so nice when there's a collective mind intent on achieveing a goal, allowing us to compliment and improve on eachother and ourselves.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="plans">
  <h2>What are my goals for the future?</h2>
 <p>A job I enjoy with people I can work with, or even just a job I enjoy by myself. If it involves programming, I'll either love it or learn to love it. I'm still new to web design, but it's quickly becoming easier and easier for me, and quickly enjoyable. </p>
